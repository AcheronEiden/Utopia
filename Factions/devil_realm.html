                <h3>The Empire of Chains</h3>
                <p>
                    Where the Abyss is a maelstrom of chaos, Hell is its perfect antithesis: a realm of absolute,
                    ordered tyranny. It is a multiverse-spanning empire built on a foundation of unbreakable laws,
                    meticulous bureaucracy, and the eternal servitude of those bound by infernal contracts. The goal of
                    the Devils is not the chaotic annihilation sought by Demons, but something far more chilling: the
                    subjugation of all existence under a single, unyielding, and eternal set of rules. Theirs is the
                    evil of the grand strategist, the patient manipulator, and the merciless ruler.

                <h3>The Infernal Hierarchy</h3>
                <p>
                    Power in Hell is not taken by brute force but earned through millennia of cunning, political
                    maneuvering, and the accrual of souls. The entire realm operates on a rigid caste system, with the
                    Demon Queen at its apex. Beneath her are the Archdevils, and commanding her legions are the four
                    generals who embody the core tenets of infernal warfare.
                </p>

                <h4>The Iron Sovereign - Demon Queen Edvina</h4>
                <p>
                    The Eighth-Order Archdevil who rules Hell as a grand chessboard. Edvina's reign is one of supreme
                    intellect and strategic patience. She sees the eternal war against the Abyss and the conquest of the
                    mortal planes as a complex game to be won not with rage, but with flawless planning and the
                    exploitation of her enemies' weaknesses.
                </p>

                <h4>The Arsenal</h4>
                <p>
                    The collective name for the four Seventh-Order generals who command Hell's armies. Each is a master
                    of a specific aspect of warfare and answers only to the Demon Queen herself.

                <div class="powerhouse-entry">
                    <h5>Belial the Sword</h5>
                    <p>
                        The master of the offensive. Belial embodies the sharp, aggressive power of Hell's legions. He
                        is a peerless duelist and a brilliant, if arrogant, field commander who believes that any
                        defense can be shattered with enough focused pressure. He leads the vanguard in every major
                        assault, his blade the first to taste enemy blood.

                <div class="powerhouse-entry">
                    <h5>Amon the Spear</h5>
                    <p>
                        The breaker of lines. Amon is the embodiment of overwhelming, focused force. A disciplined and
                        relentless tactician, he specializes in devastating charges that pierce the heart of enemy
                        formations. Where Belial is a duelist, Amon is a siege engine, his strategies designed to
                        identify a single weakness and exploit it with unstoppable power.
                    </p>

                <div class="powerhouse-entry">
                    <h5>Vepar the Shield</h5>
                    <p>
                        The architect of Hell's defense. Vepar is the most patient and unyielding of the four, a master
                        of fortification, attrition warfare, and counter-strategy. She is responsible for the
                        construction of Hell's impregnable iron fortresses and the defensive formations that have held
                        back the chaotic tides of the Abyss for eons. To attack a position fortified by Vepar is to
                        throw oneself against a wall of unbreakable iron and razor-sharp law.

                <div class="powerhouse-entry">
                    <h5>Furfur the Bow</h5>
                    <p>
                        The master of ranged warfare and psychological terror. Furfur commands the legions of archers
                        and war mages who rain down destruction from afar. He is a cold and distant commander, believing
                        that a battle should be won before the armies ever meet. His volleys are not just physical, but
                        psychological, often consisting of enchanted projectiles that inflict terror, doubt, and
                        paranoia upon the enemy ranks.

                <h3>The Society of Servitude</h3>
                <p>
                    Hell's society is a complex pyramid of servitude. Power and status are determined by one's position
                    in the infernal bureaucracy and the number and quality of souls one has bound in service. A lesser
                    devil's entire existence is a climb up this treacherous ladder, using cunning and carefully worded
                    contracts to ensnare mortals and other beings, turning their souls into currency. The landscape
                    itself reflects this obsession with order and punishment; cities are built of black, unyielding
                    iron, rivers of fire provide the power for immense war forges, and every structure is built with a
                    specific, cruel purpose in the grand, meticulous design of the empire.
