                    This compendium details the Skills known to the Martial Artists of the world. Unlike a Sorcerer's
                    spells, which are woven from imagination, these Skills are born from discipline, repetition, and the
                    channeling of mana through the physical form.

                <h3>Common Skills</h3>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Reinforce</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">General Use</span>
                    <p>The most fundamental technique for any warrior. The user channels mana into a part of their body
                        to temporarily harden their skin and muscles. A reinforced arm can block a blade, and a
                        reinforced leg can withstand a heavy impact. It is the first step in learning to treat the body
                        as a weapon.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Flowing Step</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">General Use</span>
                    <p>A basic footwork technique where the user channels a small, continuous stream of mana to their
                        feet. This lightens their steps and allows them to move more smoothly and quickly across the
                        battlefield, enabling rapid dodges and repositioning.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Piercing Thrust</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Spearman</span>
                    <p>The first skill any aspiring spearman learns. The user channels a steady stream of mana to the
                        very tip of their spear, hardening it and creating a focused point of force. This allows the
                        thrust to punch through mundane armor that would otherwise deflect the blow.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Quick Draw</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Swordsman</span>
                    <p>By channeling a burst of mana to their arm and hand, the user can draw their blade from its
                        sheath at incredible speed for a surprise attack or a swift defense.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Steady Aim</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Bowman</span>
                    <p>The user channels mana into their eyes, hands, and arms to steady their shot, dramatically
                        increasing accuracy over long distances.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Active Guard</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Shield User</span>
                    <p>The user channels mana into their shield at the moment of blocking. This reinforces the shield's
                        structure to absorb more kinetic force, reducing stamina loss and preventing the user from being
                        knocked back by heavy blows.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Uncommon Skills</h3>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Ricochet Shot</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Bowman</span>
                    <p>The user fires an arrow infused with a specific mana frequency, allowing it to bounce off one
                        physical surface without losing its momentum or lethality.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Shield Bash</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Shield User</span>
                    <p>Focusing a burst of mana into their shield, the user executes a bash that not only deals heavy
                        concussive damage but also temporarily disorients the target.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Second Wind</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">General Use</span>
                    <p>By performing a specialized breathing pattern, the user circulates mana through their body to
                        forcefully expel physical exhaustion and lactic acid from their muscles. This provides a quick,
                        potent burst of renewed stamina in the midst of a prolonged battle.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Threat Sense</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">General Use</span>
                    <p>The user extends a thin, almost imperceptible veil of their mana around their body. This aura
                        allows them to feel incoming hostile intent or fast-moving objects in their blind spots,
                        granting them a slight precognitive edge in combat.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Sweeping Gale</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Spearman</span>
                    <p>The user channels mana along the entire length of their spear and performs a wide, horizontal
                        sweep. The mana is released in a sharp arc, creating a crescent-shaped wave of force capable of
                        knocking multiple unarmored opponents off their feet.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Iai Strike</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Swordsman</span>
                    <p>A skill focused entirely on the speed of a draw-cut. The user channels a massive burst of mana
                        into their arm in the single instant they draw their sword, resulting in a strike that is
                        deceptively fast and incredibly powerful.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Rare Skills</h3>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Grand Strategist</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">General Use</span>
                    <p>The user's mind operates like a perfect tactical engine. They can perceive weaknesses in enemy
                        formations, predict probable outcomes of any engagement, and direct their armies with flawless
                        efficiency.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Seeking Arrow</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Bowman</span>
                    <p>After firing, the user maintains intense focus, allowing them to subtly manipulate the arrow's
                        trajectory mid-flight with their mana to track a moving target.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Phantom Blade</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Swordsman</span>
                    <p>The swordsman infuses their blade with mana that mimics light and shadow, causing the weapon to
                        flicker and become partially transparent during movement. This optical illusion makes it
                        incredibly difficult for an opponent to track the blade's true position, creating openings in
                        their defense.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Sunken Pike</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Spearman</span>
                    <p>A deceptive technique where the spearman thrusts their spear into the ground, channeling a large
                        amount of mana into it. The spear then travels through the earth as if it were water,
                        re-emerging at high speed from a different location to impale the target from an unexpected
                        angle.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Aegis Reflection</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">Shield User</span>
                    <p>A master-class counter-offensive skill where the user absorbs the kinetic energy of a powerful
                        physical blow into their mana-infused shield. The user can then immediately release that stored
                        energy in a devastating, forward-facing concussive blast.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Higher Tiered Physical Nullification</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">General Use</span>
                    <p>A skill that completely nullifies the physical attacks of low-level weapons and monsters below
                        the fourth rank</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-entry">
                    <h5>Cursed Speech</h5>
                    <span class="skill-user">General Use</span>
                    <p>Allows the user to imbue mana into words that affect targets. The more mana used, the more
                        powerful words can be used but with higher risk and drawbacks to the user.</p>
