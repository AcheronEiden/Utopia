            <div class="content-box">
                <p>
                    Utopia, and the planes beyond, pulsate with the life of a multitude of sentient races, each
                    contributing to the vibrant tapestry of the multiverse.
                </p>

                <h3>Humans</h3>
                <p>The most widespread race, renowned for their adaptability and boundless thirst for knowledge. Humans
                    are known as the symbol of justice and corruption.</p>

                <h3>Elves</h3>
                <p>Possess a deep connection to nature and often reside in hidden enclaves. Elves tend to be
                    introspective and prefer solitude, fiercely guarding their territories when threatened.</p>

                <h3>Dwarves</h3>
                <p>Stoic and industrious, dwarves hold a profound respect for tradition and craftsmanship. Their love
                    for forging and mining makes them unparalleled blacksmiths, crafting magical artifacts of
                    exceptional quality. Dwarves are known for their hearty appetites and legendary love of a good beer.

                <h3>2.1 Beyond the Common Races</h3>
                <p>While humans, elves, and dwarves may be the most widespread, other fascinating races inhabit the
                    planes:</p>

                <h4>Vampires</h4>
                <p>Rare and shrouded in mystery, vampires are often viewed as the embodiment of evil. In their early
                    stages, they rely on feeding on other races to grow stronger and ascend in rank. For higher-ranked
                    vampires, blood becomes less of a necessity but remains a ritualistic symbol of nobility. These
                    immortal beings cannot procreate naturally and instead turn others into vampires through a
                    blood-sharing ritual.</p>

                <h4>Demons and Devils</h4>
                <p>These ancient races reside in their respective infernal realms - the Abyss and Hell. Demons embody
                    raw chaos and destruction, reveling in carnage and violence. Devils, in contrast, are cunning
                    strategists who seek to dominate and enslave. The animosity between these two factions fuels the
                    relentless war known as the "Battlefield of Despair."</p>

                <h4>Dragons</h4>
                <p>A primordial race of immense power and unmatched arrogance, dragons are the undisputed apex
                    predators. Their bodies are naturally attuned to magic, amplifying their formidable physical
                    prowess. Dragons are incredibly rare, and their pride often leads them to view other races with
                    disdain. These magnificent creatures are said to possess the power of an Eighth Order Being at their
                    peak with the potential to become Ninth Order Beings. Due to Dragons innate abilities and
                    sensitivity to mana, they are exceptional trackers. There is a saying that goes like this:
                <blockquote>You would prefer a God chase you rather than a Dragon. Those monsters don't stop.
                </blockquote>
                </p>

                <h3>2.2 True Names and the Source of Their Power</h3>
                <p>
                    In the realm of Utopia, beings of exceptional power can be bestowed with True Names by higher
                    beings, often deities or cosmic entities. These True Names are not mere labels; they are imbued with
                    immense power, elevating the bearer's abilities far beyond their natural limits. The potency of a
                    True Name varies depending on its meaning and the nature of the being who bestowed it. A True Name
                    associated with death, for example, would grant its bearer exceptional control over death-related
                    powers, potentially even elevating them to become an embodiment of death itself.

                <h3>2.3 The Cultivation Path: From Novice to Godhood</h3>
                <p>
                    The cultivation path is divided into distinct ranks, each representing a significant increase in
                    power and understanding. The lowest rank is the First-Order Being, followed by Second, Third,
                    Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Order Beings. At the Sixth Order, a mage awakens the ability to generate
                    mana within their bodies, reducing their reliance on external mana.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the Sixth Order lies the realms of the truly powerful. Seventh and Eighth Order Beings,
                    powerhouses that command immense strength and influence. The Eighth Order, also known as the Demigod
                    level, marks a pivotal point, where mages transcend mortal limitations. The pinnacle of power is the
                    Ninth Order, granting the title of Minor God. Those who reach this level gain minor influence over
                    certain Laws of the universe, allowing them to influence those Laws themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rumors say that beyond the Ninth Order lies even greater heights, such as the True God, Primordial
                    God, and Principality ranks. Especially important is the difference between the Principality and
                    other ranks. When a Primordial God sheds their skin, they become the personification of an integral
                    part of the cosmic (for example the Principality of Death that is the personification of Death). As
                    a Principality is integral to the existence or non-existence of the universe, a Primordial God that
                    reaches the Principality rank cannot be erased from existence and only absorbed by other
                    personifications.
