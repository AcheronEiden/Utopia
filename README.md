## The Utopia World Manual
Welcome to the official repository for Utopia, a comprehensive world-building project for an original dark fantasy story. This repository serves as a living document, a "World Manual" that details the cosmology, inhabitants, power systems, and lore of a complex and ever-expanding multiverse.

## About This Project
Utopia is a personal passion project dedicated to creating a rich, detailed, and consistent fantasy world. The goal is to build a foundational lore bible that will serve as the backbone for future stories, be they novels, comics, or other creative works.

This manual is being built in public, and as such, it is a work in progress. I am continuously adding new content, refining existing lore, and expanding the universe. What you see here is the current state of a world in creation.

## What You'll Find Inside
This repository is structured like a wiki or manual, containing detailed information on:

- The Universe: The fundamental cosmology, from the central world of Utopia to the planes beyond, including the infernal domains of Hell and the Abyss.
- Races & Beings: A look at the diverse inhabitants of the multiverse, from common races like Elves and Dwarves to primordial entities like Dragons.
- Power Systems: A deep dive into the flow of mana, the paths of Martial Artists and Sorcerers, and the intricate systems of magic, skills, and legendary arts.
- Factions & Powerhouses: An introduction to the major organizations and the legendary individuals who vie for power and influence.
- Characters: Detailed profiles of key characters, exploring their histories, personalities, and abilities.
- Bestiary: A catalog of the creatures and monsters that roam the many worlds of Utopia.

And much more... including Grimoires, Treasuries, and detailed world maps.

## Usage and Contribution
I believe that creativity thrives in a community. While this is a personal project, I am happy for others to draw inspiration from the world of Utopia.
