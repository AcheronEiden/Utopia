                <p>
                    The multiverse is a vast tapestry woven from countless planes of existence. Each is a unique reality, and travel between them is a perilous feat, made possible only by the great portals established in the central world of Utopia. While the number of planes is endless, scholars and mages have managed to map and understand a select few, providing a glimpse into the sheer diversity of creation.

                <h3>8.1 The Central Realm: Utopia</h3>
                <p>Utopia is the nexus of the multiverse, a world that serves as the bridge between disparate realities. Its primary continent, Aethelgard, is a sprawling landmass of immense geographical and cultural diversity, largely due to the influx of races from across the planes.</p>
                
                <h4>The Valerium Peaks</h4>
                <p>A formidable mountain range that scrapes the sky in the northern regions of Aethelgard. Deep within these mountains lies the Dwarven Kingdom of Khaz'Grorum. It is a marvel of subterranean architecture, a city of grand forges, echoing halls, and deep respect for tradition and craftsmanship.</p>

                <h4>The Whispering Woods</h4>
                <p>An ancient and deeply magical forest that encircles the heartlands of the continent. This is the primary domain of the Elves in Utopia. The woods are a place of serene beauty and hidden dangers, where the trees are as old as the mountains. The Elves reside in hidden enclaves, preferring solitude and fiercely guarding their territories from intrusion.</p>

                <h4>The Lonely Mountain</h4>
                <p>A singular, menacing peak in the desolate eastern lands, perpetually wreathed in shadow and crowned by an active volcano. This is the feared headquarters of the Divine Cult of the Heavenly Demon. The mountain itself is a fortress, home to the seven malevolent palaces.</p>

                <h4>The Crimson Dominion</h4>
                <p>Located in the western part of Aethelgard, this is the territory of the Blood Empire. The land is locked in a state of perpetual twilight under blood-red skies. Grand, gothic castles pierce the clouds, and an oppressive, aristocratic order is maintained by the Vampire royalty.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>8.2 A Glimpse into the Planes</h3>
                <p>Beyond Utopia, a multitude of other worlds exist. While most remain inaccessible and unknown, a few have been documented.</p>
                
                <h4>The Ethereal Plane</h4>
                <p>Not a world in the traditional sense, but a realm of pure thought, spirit, and potential. It is a sea of shifting energy and consciousness, from which divine and demonic entities can be summoned. The laws of physics are meaningless here; there is only belief and will.</p>

                <h4>Syl'vanar</h4>
                <p>Believed to be the ancestral home world of the Elves, Syl'vanar is a plane where nature itself is the dominant, sentient force. Entire forests act as a single organism, and rivers flow with pure life energy. It is a world of breathtaking and untamed natural beauty.</p>

                <h4>The Crystalline Labyrinth</h4>
                <p>An alien world formed entirely from living, geometric crystals. The landscape is a maze of glowing facets and resonating structures. Life here does not conform to biological norms; instead, crystalline entities move and communicate through pulses of light and harmonic frequencies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>8.3 The Infernal Domains</h3>
                <p>Separate from the known planes exist two malevolent dimensions, locked in an eternal and brutal war.</p>

                <h4>Hell</h4>
                <p>The domain of the Devils. Hell is a realm of ordered tyranny and meticulous punishment. It is a structured hierarchy of nine distinct layers, each governed by a powerful Archdevil and designed for a specific purpose of suffering and control. Cities of black iron stand amidst rivers of fire, all under a rigid code of laws.</p>
                
                <h4>The Abyss</h4>
                <p>The domain of the Demons. The Abyss is the embodiment of pure chaos. It is a roiling, unstable maelstrom of raw energy and destructive impulse, with landscapes that shift and reform without reason. There is no law here save for the will of the strongest.</p>

                <h4>The Battlefield of Despair</h4>
                <p>This is the name given to the desolate plane caught in the crossfire between Hell and the Abyss. It is a war-torn wasteland of gray ash and black dust, littered with the soul-scarred ruins of celestial fortresses and the bones of countless fallen demons and devils.</p>
                <h5>The Forgotten Shore</h5>
                <p>This harrowing and deceptively beautiful landscape serves as the only known gateway for mortals into the Battlefield. The terrain stretches out under a somber, grey sky, with black, necrotic earth and a sea of vibrant crimson, blade-like coral formations. The journey is made near-impossible by the lurking monstrosities and the silent, skeletal leviathans that drift in the sky.</p>
                <h5>The Hollow Mountains</h5>
                <p>Serving as the dreadful border to the deeper horrors of the Battlefield, the Hollow Mountains are a massive chain of tall, jagged peaks. This region is considered a death zone, an abyss filled with unfathomable horrors and the chilling malice of alien wills that assault the mind. Great abominations and Cursed ones move like shadows in the mist.</p>
