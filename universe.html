                    Utopia exists within a vast and complex multiverse, a tapestry woven from countless planes. Each plane is a unique world teeming with diverse races, cultures, and magic systems. Travel between these planes is normally impossible, a perilous journey reserved for the most powerful beings. However, through the collaboration of scholars and mages, powerful portals have been established within the central world - Utopia itself.

                <h3>1.1 The Everlasting Void: A sea of secrets</h3>
                <p>
                    Beyond the known planes lies the void, a desolate expanse encompassing the remnants of dead worlds. This treacherous domain shimmers with the dangerous allure of the unknown. The void is a graveyard of shattered planes, littered with "spatial rifts" - swirling vortexes akin to black holes that threaten to consume anything foolish enough to get nearby. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Unknown races and creatures, remnants of forgotten civilizations or perhaps even more horrifying entities, are rumored to lurk within the void's depths. Only the most skilled and foolhardy dare to venture into this cosmic wasteland.

                <h3>1.2 The Duality of Evil: Hell, and the Abyss</h3>
                <p>
                    Separate from the void, yet undeniably connected, exist two malevolent dimensions: Hell, and the Abyss. These infernal realms are the domains of demons and devils respectively. For millennia, these infernal beings have waged a relentless war, christened "The Battlefield of Despair", their animosity bleeding into the very fabric of reality. The demons, chaotic and destructive, revel in pure carnage. The devils, cunning and meticulous, seek to control and dominate. Both forces represent a constant threat to the stability of the multiverse.
                </p>

                <h3>1.3 The Path of the Mage: Martial Might and Sorcery</h3>
                <p>
                    Those who dedicate themselves to the pursuit of martial and mystical arts are known as mages. Their ultimate goal is never-ending evolution, a lifelong journey towards transcending the limitations of the mortal coil. This never-ending evolution involves rigorous training, allowing a mage to absorb and refine the ever-present mana that permeates the universe. By harnessing this energy, mages not only enhance their physical prowess but also extend their lifespan.
                    <br> <br>
                    While mages are undeniably stronger and more resilient than ordinary humans, it's only upon reaching the Eighth Order of cultivation that they truly break free from the shackles of time, achieving an everlasting state. However, even immortality comes with its caveats. These powerful entities can still succumb to violence, fatal wounds, or the unpredictable dangers of spatial rifts - unstable cracks in reality that connect directly to the void.
                    <br> <br>
                    The cosmos operates under a complex system of fundamental principles known as Laws. Understanding these Laws allows mages to manipulate and influence various aspects of reality, ultimately increasing their power. These Laws are categorized into two tiers:

                    <h4>True Laws</h4>These represent the core principles governing a specific aspect of the universe. Comprehending a True Law grants immense power over that aspect.
                    <h4>Minor Laws</h4>These act as steppingstones, offering insights into specific facets of a True Law. Mastering multiple Minor Laws paves the way for comprehending the corresponding True Law.
