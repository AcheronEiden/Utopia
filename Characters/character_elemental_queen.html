                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Melian appears as a regal elven woman with long, dark hair that carries a deep emerald sheen, and her
                    eyes glow with the soft light of nature itself. She adorns herself in elegant robes woven from
                    moonlight and leaves, accented with living wood and glowing emeralds. Her presence does not exude
                    fear, but rather the immense, ancient pressure of a deep forest or the calm power of a gathering
                    storm.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Melian is the embodiment of balance and preservation. She is deeply empathetic to the natural world,
                    able to feel the pain of a blighted forest or the joy of a new bloom across her entire domain. Her
                    wisdom is born from millennia of patience, viewing time through the slow growth of ancient trees.
                    While she is serene and gentle by nature, her disposition changes dramatically when the balance of
                    her domain is threatened. In such times, her calm demeanor gives way to the ferocity of a hurricane
                    or the unyielding power of an earthquake, proving she is a fierce protector of her people and the
                    natural world.</p>

                            This is the source of the Elemental Queen's legendary resilience and the ultimate defense of her domain. Her life force is not merely her own; it is intrinsically tethered to the entirety of the Whispering Woods. Her physical body is but a vessel, a focal point for her consciousness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When faced with a threat she cannot otherwise overcome or an attack that would prove fatal, Melian can activate the skill's true nature. She voluntarily unravels her physical form, dispersing her consciousness and spiritual essence into the very fabric of the forest—the ancient trees, the flowing streams, the living soil, and the air itself. In this state, she is everywhere and nowhere, rendering her immune to conventional harm.

                            As long as a single leaf remains in her domain, she cannot be truly killed. She can reconstitute her physical body anywhere within the woods, fully restored. This turns any assassination attempt into a grueling war of attrition against an entire, living world—a war an invader is guaranteed to lose.
