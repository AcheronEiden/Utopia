                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Edvina presents herself with a chilling and regal beauty, her pale skin a stark contrast to her
                    sharp, black horns and the vast, leathery wings that rest behind her. She is often seen seated upon
                    a throne of jagged obsidian and cooled iron, dressed in elegant but imposing dark attire that seems
                    woven from solidified shadow. Her eyes glow with a cold, calculating intelligence, and her every
                    movement is precise and deliberate, betraying none of her true intentions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>A formidable leader from the ordered realm of Hell, Edvina stands at the forefront of the Devil race
                    with cunning and strategic brilliance. She is a grand strategist who views the Universe as a cosmic
                    chessboard. Her every action and word is calculated to further her ultimate goal: to control and
                    dominate all of existence. She rules through intellect, fear, and unbreakable infernal contracts,
                    not through brute force. She is patient and regal, possessing an unshakable confidence that comes
                    from millennia of outmaneuvering her enemies.</p>

                        Names of countless enslaved souls, allowing her to draw upon their power.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scroll of a Thousand Pacts:</strong> An ancient, ever-extending scroll upon which all of
                        her infernal contracts are written. It is a divine relic that enforces the terms of her bargains
                        across all planes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scepter of Tyranny:</strong> A staff topped with a captive, screaming flame from the
                        deepest pits of Hell. It acts as a symbol of her authority and a potent focus for her fire
                        magic.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Arts</h3>
                <h4>Mana Sense [Common, Active]</h4>
                <h4>Kinetic Redirection [Uncommon, Active]</h4>
                <h4>Hollow Sphere [Rare, Active]</h4>
                <h4>Infernal Decree [Legendary, Active]</h4>
                <h4>Domain Declaration - The Iron Court of Judgment [Legendary, Active]</h4>
                <p>Edvina's domain transforms the battlefield into a terrifying courtroom from the depths of Hell,
                    complete with chains, cages, and a judge's throne. Within this court, she is the absolute judge and
                    jury. The guaranteed-hit effect manifests as unbreakable chains of judgment that erupt from the
                    ground, binding her targets and subjecting them to the "laws" of her court, which can include the
                    negation of magic, the draining of life force, or forced servitude.</p>
                <h4>Sovereign Edict [Mythical, Active]</h4>
                <p>An art learned from the <strong>True Law of the World</strong>, allows Edvina to impose a single,
                    absolute rule upon a designated area. By declaring a simple, prohibitive command (an 'edict'), she
                    overwrites the natural laws within that space, enforcing her will upon it. For example, she could
                    declare "No flight" or "No healing," and reality within the edict's bounds would bend to make it so.

                <h3>Hereditary Skills</h3>
                <h4>Contractual Dominion</h4>
                <p>Edvina's innate skill as an Archdevil. Anyone who enters into a verbal or written contract with her
                    is magically bound to its terms. She can perceive the thoughts of those bound to her and enforce
                    obedience through excruciating pain with a mere thought.</p>
                <h4>Binding Word</h4>
                <p>A form of Cursed Speech unique to devils that allows devils to bind those weaker than themselves to
                    their will. When invoked, it can compel obedience or inflict pain upon the target.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soul-Pact Brand (Tier 15):</strong> A complex enchantment that places a magical brand on
                        a target. This brand allows Edvina to slowly siphon their power and knowledge over time, and it
                        acts as a permanent tracking beacon across the planes.</li>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Binding Word: Kneel:</strong> A form of Cursed Speech unique to devils. It carries the weight
                    of infernal law, compelling those with weaker wills to physically kneel before her in submission.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Binding Word: Confess:</strong> Forces a target to answer one question truthfully, though the
                    magical backlash on the caster is significant if the target's will is strong.</p>
