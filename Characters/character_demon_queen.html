                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Edvina presents herself with a chilling and regal beauty, her pale skin a stark contrast to her
                    sharp, black horns and the vast, leathery wings that rest behind her. She is often seen seated upon
                    a throne of jagged obsidian and cooled iron, dressed in elegant but imposing dark attire that seems
                    woven from solidified shadow. Her eyes glow with a cold, calculating intelligence, and her every
                    movement is precise and deliberate, betraying none of her true intentions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>A formidable leader from the ordered realm of Hell, Edvina stands at the forefront of the Devil race
                    with cunning and strategic brilliance. She is a grand strategist who views the Universe as a cosmic
                    chessboard. Her every action and word is calculated to further her ultimate goal: to control and
                    dominate all of existence. She rules through intellect, fear, and unbreakable infernal contracts,
                    not through brute force. She is patient and regal, possessing an unshakable confidence that comes
                    from millennia of outmaneuvering her enemies.</p>

                        courtroom from the depths of Hell. Within this court, she is the absolute judge and jury. The
                        guaranteed-hit effect manifests as unbreakable chains of judgment that bind her targets and
                        subject them to the "laws" of her court, which can include the negation of magic, the draining
                        of life force, or forced servitude.</div>

                        declaring a simple, prohibitive command (an 'edict'), she overwrites the natural laws within
                        that space, enforcing her will upon it. For example, she could declare "No flight" or "No
                        healing," and reality within the edict's bounds would bend to make it so.</div>
