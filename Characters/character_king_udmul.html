                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>King Udmul is the epitome of a Dwarven king: broad, immensely powerful, and radiating an aura of
                    unshakable stability. His long, silver beard is intricately braided and clasped with runes of power.
                    He is always seen in a suit of masterfully crafted golden armor, so perfectly fitted that it moves
                    with him as a second skin. He sits upon a throne of solid granite, his presence not one of menace,
                    but of the deep, quiet strength of the mountain itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>A just and compassionate king from the grand, subterranean halls of the Dwarven Kingdom, King Udmul
                    leads his people with profound wisdom and fairness. He is a bastion of tradition who views his
                    kingdom not as a territory to be held, but as a family to be nurtured. Unlike the sorcerers who
                    weave magic, Udmul's power is direct and tangible, rooted in the discipline of a master martial
                    artist and the unparalleled skill of a runesmith. He is slow to anger but implacable once roused,
                    fighting with the straightforward, overwhelming force of an avalanche.</p>

                <h3>Items</h3>
                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <strong>Aether, The World Shaper</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">One of the seven sentient weapons of the Primordial Armory. A pair of
                        gauntlets woven from solidified nebula. They grant unparalleled control over elements,
                        particularly Metal and Lightning, allowing the user to transmute matter and raise structures
                        with a gesture.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <strong>Heart of the Mountain</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">A suit of living adamantine armor forged by Udmul himself. It is directly
                        linked to his life force and can repair itself from any damage as long as he draws breath.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <strong>World-Breaker</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">A colossal warhammer forged from the heart of a fallen star. Its strikes
                        land with the force of a meteor impact, and the runes etched upon it can shatter magical
                        barriers and dispel enchantments.</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Innate Skill</h3>
                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <h4>Soul of the Forge [Mythical, Passive]</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        <p>Udmul's essence as a master artificer and warrior made manifest. His soul is intrinsically
                            linked to every item he has personally forged. This has two effects:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Symbiotic Power:</strong> The more of his own creations he wears and wields, the
                                stronger his physical attributes become. His armor is not just protection; it is an
                                extension of his own durability. His hammer is not just a weapon; it is an extension of
                                his own strength.</li>
                            <li><strong>Runic Awakening:</strong> By channeling his own stamina and mana directly into
                                an item he has forged, he can temporarily awaken its latent potential, unlocking hidden
                                powers or pushing its enchantments far beyond their normal limits for a devastating
                                final blow.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Techniques</h3>
                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <h4>Iron Fist [Common, Active]</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">The user concentrates a dense amount of mana into their fist, hardening it
                        to the consistency of iron for a single, powerful blow.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <h4>Impact Wave [Uncommon, Active]</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">The user channels a significant amount of mana into a physical strike and
                        releases it in a concussive burst upon impact, creating a short-range shockwave that can stagger
                        nearby enemies.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <h4>Iron Fortress Stance [Rare, Active]</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">A master-level defensive technique. The user adopts a rooted stance and
                        circulates a massive amount of mana throughout their body. While in this stance, the user gains
                        immense resilience to physical blows and becomes nearly immovable.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <h4>Heaven-Shaking Stomp [Legendary, Active]</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">The pinnacle of channeling mana through the body. The user
                        focuses their entire mana reserves into a single, devastating stomp. The resulting shockwave
                        sends a resonance wave through the very ley lines of the earth, creating a localized, violent
                        earthquake that can level structures and shatter armies.</div>
