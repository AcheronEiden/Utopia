                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Eiden has black hair with red reptilian eyes, deathly pale skin, and a fit body with well-defined muscles. His appearance gives him an aura exuding confidence. If Eiden uses much of his stored mana, his eyes will get a blood-red hue and he will begin emitting a predatory aura that instills fear in others.</p>
                <h4>Dragon Transformation</h4>
                <p>After transformation, Eiden undergoes rapid physical changes: his eyes shift to amethyst hues, his hair lengthens with silver highlights, and his canines sharpen while his nails become claw-like. He gains heightened danger sense and perception, and can replenish himself by consuming enemies. The transformation strips him of rationality, driving him to a predatory state focused on survival and evolution. Additionally, he gains four hands and an extra mouth, enhancing spellcasting by enabling seamless hand sign execution and simultaneous spell invocation. The supplementary mouth allows him to cast multiple spells without interruption, and the extra arms facilitate diverse spellcasting. Three pairs of eyes provide unique functions: one for normal vision, another for zooming, and the third for insight into bodily functions.</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Eiden exudes an air of serenity, his calm demeanor belying a profound detachment from the world. His pursuit of freedom is absolute, his desires taking precedence over any societal norms or expectations. To others, he looks like a creature of impulse, guided solely by his pleasure and displeasure. In stark contrast to his apathetic nature, Eiden harbors a deep fascination with power and knowledge. He seeks to elevate himself above all others, to attain a level of perfection beyond comprehension. His pursuit of these goals is driven by a twisted sense of Darwinian superiority, believing himself to be the apex of existence. Eiden believes that only the strongest, the most capable, deserve to exist.</p>
                <p>His words possess a chilling sharpness, laced with sadistic undertones. He revels in the suffering of others. Despite his callous disregard for most, Eiden harbors a deep attachment to those few he deems worthy of his affection, treating them with a rare tenderness.</p>

                <h3>Arts</h3>
                <h4>Elemental Infusion [Uncommon, Active]</h4>
                <h4>Complete Telekinesis [Rare, Active]</h4>
                <p>Learned from the <strong>True Law of Perceived Reality</strong>. It gives the ability to manipulate objects and energies at a distance with the mind alone. This skill allows for precise control over the battlefield.</p>
                <h4>Spatial Flash [Rare, Active]</h4>
                <h4>Hollow Sphere [Rare, Active]</h4>
                <h4>Domain Declaration - Dominion over Darkness [Legendary, Active]</h4>
                <p>Eiden’s strongest skill. When activated, a closed space of darkness will originate from Eiden where he has total control. Using all living beings’ primal fear of the unknown, Eiden can use the darkness to do his bidding.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Darkness manipulation:</strong> Envelop targets surroundings in pitch-black darkness that blocks vision, hearing, and touch. Blocks all types of spiritual or mana sense.</li>
                        <li><strong>Creation:</strong> Let the surrounding darkness consume corpses animating them to follow the bidding of the domain’s owner</li>
                        <li><strong>Malevolent Shrine:</strong> Using the concept of <strong>Cleave and dismantle</strong>, Eiden is able to instantly and continuously slice everything caught inside the created space. Dismantle targets objects that have mana while cleave targets objects devoid of mana, giving Malevolent Shrine the ability to slice everything and anything caught inside the domain regardless of what it is.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <blockquote>Eiden has spent the last decade attempting, albeit unsuccessfully, to perfect and evolve his domain. His goal is to execute a dismantle & cleave move capable of instantly cutting through space, existence, and even the world itself to harm the target. Eiden envisions it as, "cutting through the universe itself and erasing your existence – after all, you cannot evade something that affects your very being!"</blockquote>
                <h4>The Arcane Hijacker [Mythical, Active]</h4>
                <p>A unique art that allows the user to not only shape their own mana, but to actively hijack and re-weave an opponent's spell as it is being cast. By perceiving the fundamental structure of the incoming magic, the user can forcibly seize control of the mana flow and corrupt the spell's nature. It is the ultimate expression of magical dominance.</p>
                <h4>Eternal Hatred [Mythical, Passive]</h4>
                <p>A skill gained from learning the <strong>True Law of Immortality</strong>, it gives the user eternal life, limitless stamina and the ability of unlimited regeneration, as long as a single cell remains. All in exchange for huge amounts of mana continuously drained.</p>

                        <li><strong>Third Move: Arcane Convergence</strong>: By disorienting their inner mana and guiding it, the wielder unleashes a powerful burst of chaotic mana from the tip of their blade. This burst manifests as a laser-like beam extending from the blade's tip, its range determined by the amount of mana channeled. As the beam travels, it leaves behind a trail of corrosive energy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fourth Move: Meteor</strong>: The user slashes in a circle above themselves, creating a rift high in the sky. From this rift, a massive meteor containing condensed mana and energy hurtles down towards the target area, causing widespread devastation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fifth Move: Black Cutter</strong>: The user performs a slash that can cut through anything tangible</li>

                <p>Strikes an instinctive, uncountenable fear into those the Dragon perceives as enemies</p>
                <h4>Dragon's sin of Gluttony [Active]</h4>
                <p>Allows the user to eat anything and gain its knowledge. Lets the user imbue those weaker than him (contact needed) with an incessant hunger, making them so hungry that they would eat anything, even themselves.</p>
                <h4>Dragon's sin of Pride [Active]</h4>
                <p>The more outnumbered the user is, the stronger his attacks become and the faster and more confident he becomes</p>
                <h4>Dragon Transformation [Active]</h4>
                <p>Allows the user to transform into a dragon, gaining enhanced physical abilities, flight, and access to <strong>Dragon Breath</strong> of the same type they inherently possess.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dragon’s claw:</strong> A tier 15 spell that imbue Eiden's claws with void mana, allowing them to slice through any material and even mana-based attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximize Magic: Reality Slash:</strong> A tier 20 spell that allows Eiden to use a sword to slash through the air, and the following slash cuts through “the fabric of space”. Reality slash can even destroy other attacks and defensive spells. Consumes at least ¼ of Eiden’s mana. The spells was created by combining the Minor Laws of Space, Time, and Gravity so it can’t be taught without knowing the corresponding Laws.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reaper’s Embrace:</strong> A super-tier spell that, in exchange for all of his stored mana and a drop in rank, allows Eiden to form a gigantic humanoid avatar in the form of a reaper {black clock with a skull for a face and a gigantic scythe} that surrounds Eiden, and mimics his move. Due to a combination of the True Law of Death and True Law of Lightning, each slash contains the full power of a top Eighth-rank being, deals true death and arrives instantaneously.</li>

                <blockquote>“I am the apex. My existence alone is proof that those standing in my path are small and insignificant. I am both the beginning and the end, destruction made flesh. Nigh unconquerable and entirely unstoppable.”</blockquote>
                <blockquote>“Gaze upon my face so that you know exactly who will kill you, children. I am the dragon of judgement, and I am coming... Treasure your immortal lives more carefully, because I will come to claim them soon. I am the darkness waiting at the end of everything. Unbreakable and unstoppable.”</blockquote>
                <blockquote>“Arise and greet your new king. Praise these steps I take with your blood. Bless this body’s ascension with your tears. Use your screams as trumpets for me”</blockquote>
