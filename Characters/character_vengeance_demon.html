                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Kaelen presents a figure of immense, unyielding strength. His body is encased in a suit of dark,
                    jagged armor that seems to be a part of him, glowing with faint, violet light from the cracks. He
                    moves with the slow, deliberate certainty of a tectonic plate, his presence exuding not malice, but
                    an overwhelming sense of grim determination and absolute resolve. His face is rarely seen, but his
                    eyes glow from within his helm with a cold, unwavering light.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>As the emperor of a faction perpetually on the defensive, Kaelen is the embodiment of pragmatism. He
                    is not a kind ruler, nor is he needlessly cruel; every decision is weighed on a scale of strategic
                    necessity. He carries the immense burden of protecting humanity from a world of horrors, and this
                    has forged him into a being of pure, unshakeable will. He is respected, not loved, and feared by his
                    enemies not for his aggression, but for his legendary ability to endure any assault and return the
                    pain he receives a hundredfold. His title comes from his core philosophy: true victory is achieved
                    by making the enemy regret they ever chose to attack.</p>

                        whose surface is a shimmering temporal distortion. It offers absolute defense by displacing
                        attacks in time, shunting a physical blow a few seconds into the future or aging a spell until

                        <p>Kaelen's signature ability and the source of his title. Passively, his body and soul act as a

                            within a certain radius. He can then activate the skill to unleash this stored suffering.
                        </p>

                        immense resilience to physical blows and becomes nearly immovable, at the cost of mobility.

                        absolute. The guaranteed-hit effect manifests as spectral chains that erupt from the ground,
                        binding his target. For every attack the target makes while chained, a ghostly soldier rises and
                        strikes them with an identical, unavoidable blow, turning their own aggression into a
                        self-destructive barrage.
