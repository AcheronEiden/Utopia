                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Ada retains the otherworldly beauty and regal grace that once won the hearts of her subjects, making
                    her betrayal all the more chilling. She wears elegant, dark gowns that blend royal finery with the
                    subtle, unnerving symbols of the Divine Cult. She moves with a serene confidence, her expression
                    often a placid, unreadable mask. Her eyes, once warm, now hold a cold, pragmatic light that reveals
                    nothing of her true motivations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>The true enigma of the Divine Cult. Once the beloved queen of a prosperous human kingdom, Ada shocked
                    the world by betraying her people to join the Void Monarch. On the surface, her mind is a fortress;
                    she operates with a tactical brilliance and pragmatism that is utterly detached from conventional
                    morality. It is unknown whether she was coerced, converted, or is playing a deeper game. This
                    ambiguity, combined with her unshakable composure, makes her a dangerous and unpredictable force.
                    She has traded the love of her people for a belief in a harsher order, a philosophy that aligns
                    perfectly with her new master... or so it seems.</p>
                <p class="system-message">System Alert: High-priority target. Mandate is to retrieve unharmed. Lethal
                    force is not authorized. Asset is critical.</p>

                        now serves as a potent focus for her magic and a grim reminder of the kingdom she abandoned.

                        <p>Ada's unique ability as a born ruler, now perfected as a battlefield commander. She can place

                                or mistake allies for foes. As a final command, she can force one marked enemy to
                                unleash a single, uncontrollable attack on another marked enemy.</li>

                        object. This creates a sympathetic link, allowing the creator to feel the general location and

                        Ada's domain recreates a spectral, twisted version of her former throne room. It is not a place
                        of direct violence, but of absolute psychological warfare. The guaranteed-hit effect is not a
                        physical attack, but a powerful illusion that preys on the target's deepest regrets, fears, and
                        doubts. Allies appear as enemies, cherished memories become sources of torment, and the target's
                        own power seems to turn against them, leaving them mentally broken and vulnerable.
