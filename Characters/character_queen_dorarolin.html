                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Dorarolin cuts a starkly different figure from a traditional Dwarf. While she possesses their
                    inherent sturdiness, she carries herself with the cold, arrogant grace of a sorceress. Her haid is
                    short and meticulously styled, and her eyes hold a sharp, calculating glint. She is always adorned
                    in opulent robes woven with threads of gold and silver, and wears jewelry crafted from cursed, yet
                    beautiful, gemstones that seem to drink the light. Her presence is not one of warmth, but of the
                    cold, unyielding pressure of the deep earth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Consumed by a bottomless jealousy and an insatiable thirst for power, Dorarolin is a volatile and
                    cunning ruler who holds sway over a significant portion of the Dwarven people. She sees Udmul's
                    mercy and tradition as weakness, believing that true power lies in absolute control and the
                    acquisition of wealth. Her every action is a calculated move to undermine her rival, amass personal
                    power, and prove that her mastery of sorcery—a path often viewed with suspicion by her people—is
                    superior to the "outdated" ways of the forge and the axe. She is a master of political intrigue,
                    preying on the greed of others to sow dissent within the Dwarven Kingdom.</p>

                                honor becomes crippling self-doubt, a sorcerer's ambition becomes reckless abandon. It
                                is a power that does not break the body, but the soul.</li>

                <h3>Backstory</h3>
                <p>Dorarolin hails from the prestigious Blackvein Clan, known for their unparalleled skill in
                    metallurgy and enchantment. From a young age, she exhibited a prodigious talent for magic, much to
                    the chagrin of her traditionalist family. Her obsession with power and wealth grew as she delved
                    deeper into forbidden magics, ultimately leading her to challenge the established order of the
                    Dwarven Kingdom.</p>
                <p>Her rise to power was marked by ruthless ambition and cunning political maneuvers. She orchestrated
                    coups, manipulated trade routes to amass wealth, and formed alliances with unsavory factions,
                    including dark sorcerers and mercenaries. Her ultimate goal is to usurp King Udmul and reshape the
                    Dwarven Kingdom in her own image—a realm where power is absolute, and greed is celebrated.</p>
                <p>Dorarolin's relationship with Udmul is one of bitter rivalry. She views his mercy and adherence to
                    tradition as weaknesses that have made the kingdom vulnerable. In contrast, she believes that only
                    through strength, fear, and the accumulation of wealth can true order be maintained. This ideological
                    clash has led to a deep-seated animosity between the two, with Dorarolin constantly seeking ways to
                    undermine his rule and prove her superiority.</p>
