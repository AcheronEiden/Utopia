                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>The Primordial Shadow does not possess a fixed form but manifests as a shifting, terrifying silhouette that seems to actively absorb all light, rendering details impossible to discern. It typically adopts a tall, slender, and unnervingly regal humanoid shape, wreathed in purple-black shadows that ripple like heat distortion. It has no discernible face, but its presence is marked by two pinpoints of cold, brilliant white or violet light where eyes should be. Its aura is not one of fire or rage, but of absolute cosmic coldness, instilling a primal dread that transcends normal fear.</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>An entity of pure, cold conviction. The Shadow is chillingly pragmatic and utterly devoid of emotion or personal desire. It exists solely to fulfill the Divine Cult's apocalyptic mission: the mathematical annihilation of the multiverse to restore it to a state of pre-existence. It treats all beings, even its devoted followers, as mere variables in a grand equation of entropy, moving them around the cosmic chessboard with detached, flawless logic. It views the struggles of mortal beings, and even the ambitions of the Eighth-Order Archdevils and Archdemons, as fleeting noise before the inevitability of true silence.</p>

                    <strong>The Scourge of Uncreation</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">A silent, invisible force field that wraps around the Shadow. It is not armor, but a continuous anti-magic bubble that instantly nullifies and unweaves any spell of Tier 15 or lower that contacts it.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <strong>The Scepter of Finality</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">A twisted staff of black, non-reflective metal topped by a single, perfectly still Void Crystal. It acts as an absolute focus for Void Magic, allowing the Shadow to channel apocalyptic spells without the need for traditional incantations or hand signs.</div>

                    <h4>Eternal Absence [Mythical, Passive]</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        <p>The Shadow's existence is a fundamental contradiction to life. Passively, its presence causes a localized loss of mana sensitivity in others, and mana-based attacks are intrinsically weakened near it. Furthermore, any being who attempts to perceive the Shadow's True Name, identity, or origins through magic or divination suffers immediate, catastrophic soul damage, forcing them to forget the attempt instantly.</p>
                        <p>This skill ensures the Shadow remains an unfathomable mystery, protecting it from both metaphysical and strategic assault.</p>

                    <h4>Decree of Heaven [Legendary, Active]</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">A legendary and forbidden art that allows the user to directly interfere with the threads of causality and fate. By expending a vast amount of their personal karmic luck, the user issues a single, absolute, conditional statement—a "Decree"—that Heaven and Earth is compelled to enforce.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="tooltip-item">

                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        The Shadow's domain transforms the battlefield into a void-like space of absolute stillness and darkness where all sound and light are consumed. The guaranteed-hit effect is <strong>pure entropy</strong> made manifest: living beings within the domain begin to age at an accelerated rate, magical artifacts crack and fail, and spells are unweaved into nothingness, their very purpose forgotten.

                    <h4>Manifold Detachment (Super-Tier Spell)</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        A spell that fundamentally breaks the laws of physics and dimensions. The caster targets a large area (a fortress, a forest, an entire island) and surgically "cuts" it out of the fabric of the plane. The detached section of reality is then shunted into its own isolated, inescapable pocket dimension. This is not teleportation, but a permanent exile from the known universe, effectively unmaking a piece of the world.

                    <h4>Supreme Art: Causality Shift</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        A terrifying spell that allows the user to select a single, recent event—an opponent’s attack, a completed spell, or a fatal blow—and instantly <strong>redefine its outcome</strong>. It is functionally the ability to declare "that never happened," causing the attack to vanish and the opponent's action to revert, forcing reality to patch the temporal paradox. It can only be used few times per confrontation.

                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <h4>Supreme Art: Absolute Singularity</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        The ultimate mastery of Gravity and Void Magic. The caster targets a single being or object and causes the immediate space around it to collapse into a microscopic, temporary <strong>black hole</strong>. The target is instantly and irreversibly crushed out of conventional existence, exiled into a space-time anomaly from which no escape is possible.
