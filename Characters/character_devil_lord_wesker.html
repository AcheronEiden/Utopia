                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Wesker's true face is an enigma, forever hidden behind a smiling, demonic mask of white porcelain and
                    black markings. This mask is the focal point of his chilling presence, its painted grin never
                    faltering, making his true intentions utterly impossible to read. He is tall and gaunt, clad in
                    layers of dark, ceremonial robes that obscure his form. He moves with a silent, predatory grace, his
                    every gesture deliberate and unnerving.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>A high-ranking lord in the armies of Hell and the Demon Queen's most trusted subordinate, Wesker is
                    the embodiment of cold, calculated cruelty. He is a master of psychological warfare, delighting in
                    the slow, methodical dismantling of his enemies' minds and loyalties. He speaks in a calm, measured
                    tone that is often more terrifying than any shout, and he uses praise and intellectual curiosity as
                    weapons. While he serves the Demon Queen with absolute loyalty, it is a loyalty born of a shared
                    philosophy: that the universe is a game of control, and the greatest victory is not just to defeat
                    an opponent, but to make them break themselves.</p>

                    <strong>The Mask of Many Faces</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">Wesker's signature mask. It is a divine relic that not only hides his
                        presence from magical detection but allows him to perfectly mimic the voice and mannerisms of
                        any being he has observed.</div>

                    <strong>The Soul-Stitched Scroll</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">A scroll made from the flayed souls of failed strategists. It contains
                        countless forbidden enchantments and curses, and he can unleash them by simply reading the
                        victim's name from its surface.</div>

                        <p>Wesker's power is to give a face to his opponent's deepest fears. By peering into a target's
                            mind, he can project a perfect, hyper-realistic illusion of the person or entity they dread
                            most.</p>
                        <p>This illusion is not merely visual; it speaks with the victim's own voice of self-doubt,
                            knows their most secret failures, and can even appear to wield their own abilities against
                            them. It is the ultimate tool for turning an enemy's mind into their own personal prison.

                        to a Domain Declaration. It erects a small, personal barrier of "unwritten" reality that
                        nullifies the unavoidable hit effect of any domain it is cast within.</div>

                        Wesker's domain transforms the battlefield into a twisted, never-ending carnival filled with
                        distorted mirrors and unsettling marionettes that wear the faces of the target's loved ones. The
                        guaranteed-hit effect is a continuous psychic assault; the mirrors reflect the target's worst
                        failures, the marionettes whisper their deepest insecurities, and the cheerful carnival music
                        becomes a maddening cacophony that erodes sanity and willpower, leaving the victim a hollow
                        shell.
