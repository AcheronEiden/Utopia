                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>The God of the Bible is never seen in a fixed, physical form by mortal eyes. It manifests only as pure, blinding white light and a resonating voice that echoes across the multiverse. When necessary, it condenses its presence into a figure of impossible perfection, typically appearing as a radiant, androgynous being cloaked in celestial armor woven from starlight and pure Light Magic. This form is often surrounded by a chorus of Archangels and is usually perceived seated upon a massive throne made of crystallized time. Its presence instills not fear, but profound awe and an inescapable sense of being perfectly judged.</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>The God of the Bible is the embodiment of absolute, impartial Law and perfect Order. It is a being of serene, uncompromising justice. There is no malice, but also no mercy; its actions are purely dictated by the necessity of maintaining cosmic harmony and ensuring the survival of Creation against the entropy of the Void. It views the multiverse as a perfectly designed mechanism, and any disruption (like the Primordial Shadow's annihilation) must be corrected with absolute finality. Its judgment is cold, rational, and entirely concerned with the greater good, making it the perfect, unwavering wall against chaos.</p>

                    <strong>The Tabernacle of Creation</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">A celestial relic that can instantly conjure any object, element, or complex structure up to the size of a mountain. It is the perfect tool for repairing reality after an attack by the Primordial Shadow.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <strong>Sword of Judgment</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">A massive, ethereal blade made of condensed light. It is not wielded physically, but appears and strikes upon the God's mental command. It is capable of severing the spiritual threads that bind a being to their body, inflicting true death on all but other Ninth-Order entities.</div>

                    <h4>Omnipresent Will [Mythical, Passive]</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        <p>The ultimate expression of universal authority. Passively, the God of the Bible is perpetually attuned to every True and Minor Law across all planes. Any being who violates a universal law (e.g., attempting a chaotic, unweaved spell, lying in its presence, or breaking a physical constant) is instantly subjected to an unavoidable punishment that scales with the offense, often manifesting as a debilitating temporal slow or a surge of purifying light that causes excruciating pain.</p>
                        <p>Against the Primordial Shadow, this creates a constant, draining backlash whenever the Shadow uses its chaotic powers, ensuring the stalemate remains viable.</p>

                    <h4>Divine Command - Fiat Lux (Let There Be Light) [Legendary, Active Art]</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        <p>The perfect counter to the Primordial Shadow's erasure. The God of the Bible issues a simple, absolute command: "Let there be Light." This instantaneously creates a colossal wave of pure, white Light Magic that transforms Void Energy into neutral Mana and instantly restores any physical matter or mana-based structure that has been erased, dispelled, or corrupted within its radius. It is an act of Creation that effortlessly reverses entropy.</p>

                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        The God's domain transforms the battlefield into a flawless, endless expanse of white marble and pure starlight, where the air itself rings with the sound of angelic choirs. The guaranteed-hit effect is absolute <strong>Lawful Binding</strong>: the target is encased in unbreakable chains of solidified law, and their ability to draw and use mana is drastically suppressed and regulated according to the most rigid cosmic rules.

                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        A power unique to a master of Time Magic. The God of the Bible targets a large area and <strong>reverses the flow of time</strong> within it to any chosen moment in the recent past (up to one hour). This undoes all damage, resets all mana expenditure, and reverses all actions performed within that duration, making any victory against it entirely temporary unless the God itself is defeated.

                    <h4>Cosmic Jury (Super-Tier Spell)</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        The ultimate declaration of divine justice. The God of the Bible summons seven spectral manifestations of the True Laws (e.g., Time, Death, Immortality, etc.). Each projection bombards the enemy with attacks that exploit every violation of that specific Law the target has committed throughout their existence. It is a terrifying judgment that weaponizes the opponent's own history and moral failures against them.

                    <h4>Supreme Art: Jacob’s Ladder</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        An ultimate, indiscriminate Art that manifests a Celestial Chronometer. It calls down a colossal pillar of raw, annihilating light that continuously scours and un-makes everything within a multi-kilometer radius for twenty inexorable minutes. This light is imbued with the pure essence of cosmic law, making it impossible to resist or evade. Any being caught within its radius is subjected to absolute erasure from existence, their very essence unbound from reality itself. Only beings of Ninth-Order or higher can survive its effects, and even they are left gravely weakened.
