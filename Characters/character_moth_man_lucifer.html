                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Lucifer appears as a tall, unnervingly thin being with deathly pale skin and long, white hair. His
                    features are sharp and aristocratic, but his most unsettling feature is his eyes, which are pools of
                    pure black that seem to absorb the light around them. He wears simple, dark robes that drift around
                    him as if caught in an unseen wind, and two large, black horns curve gracefully from his brow. His
                    presence does not inspire fear in the traditional sense, but a deep, primal sense of wrongness, as
                    if reality itself is fraying at the edges just by being near him.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Lucifer's personality is one of ancient, nihilistic pride. Unlike the devils of Hell who seek to
                    conquer and enslave, Lucifer, like all demons, desires only to unmake creation. He sees destruction
                    as the ultimate art form and chaos as the purest, most beautiful state of being. He views the order
                    and laws of the cosmos with utter contempt, seeking to extinguish the light of existence and return
                    all things to a silent, perfect nothingness. He is not loud or boisterous in his evil; he is quiet,
                    contemplative, and absolute in his conviction, which makes him all the more terrifying.</p>

                    <strong>Balerion, The Black Dread</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">One of the seven sentient weapons of the Primordial Armory. A cursed black
                        sword that becomes part of its wielder's body, stored as a tattoo when not in use. It is capable
                        of cutting through anything and can unlock a "Blood Form" that grants a huge jump in power.

                <div class="tooltip-item">
                    <strong>Mantle of Unraveling</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">A cloak woven from the essence of a collapsed star. It does not offer
                        physical protection; instead, it passively absorbs and dissipates any magical energy that comes
                        near it, causing spells to fray and weaken before they can connect.</div>

                    <strong>The Shard of Non-Existence</strong>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">A small, black crystal that Lucifer wears as a pendant. It is a fragment
                        of a reality that was completely erased from existence. It acts as a potent focus for his Void
                        Magic, allowing him to cast world-ending spells with greater ease.</div>

                        <p>Lucifer's very presence is a blight upon ordered reality. A passive aura surrounds him at all
                            times, subtly corrupting the fundamental laws of the universe. Within this field,
                            probability shifts, spells have a chance to fail or produce wildly different effects, and
                            the very ground can twist into unnatural shapes. It is a constant, low-level version of the
                            Abyss itself made manifest, making him an incredibly unpredictable and dangerous opponent to
                            fight directly.</p>

                    <h4>Spell Splicing [Rare, Active]</h4>
                    <div class="tooltip-text">An advanced and dangerous art where a sorcerer casts two different spells
                        simultaneously, weaving them together. If successful, this can create a single, combined effect
                        of immense power and unpredictability. A perfect art for a master of chaos.</div>

                        Lucifer does not create a new space; he simply invites the Abyss into the current one. His
                        domain manifests as a zone of absolute silence where colors desaturate to grey and the laws of
                        physics begin to fail. The guaranteed-hit effect is entropy itself: matter slowly disintegrates,
                        magical energy dissipates into nothingness, and living beings begin to crumble to dust, their
                        very existence being gently but inexorably erased from the timeline.

                        Lucifer targets a being or object and bombards it with pure chaotic energy. This does not cause a physical explosion, but an "informational" one. The target begins to lose its fundamental properties: a stone wall forgets how to be solid and drips like liquid, an enchanted sword forgets its sharpness, and a living being's body forgets its own structure, with limbs rearranging themselves into impossible configurations.

                    <div class="tooltip-text wide-tooltip">
                        Lucifer does not attack directly. Instead, he designates an area and warps the perceptual laws within it. To those trapped inside, the sky becomes the ground and the ground becomes the sky. Gravity pulls them in multiple directions at once, and their own attacks may loop around to strike them from behind. It is a disorienting hellscape where the concept of "direction" is annihilated.

                        Lucifer's most profound act of unmaking. He points at a location and declares a single concept to be null and void within that area. If he nullifies "sound," it becomes a sphere of absolute, maddening silence. If he nullifies "color," everything turns to shades of indescribable gray. If he nullifies "cohesion," everything within the zone, from castles to mountains, simply drifts apart into a cloud of constituent atoms. It is the surgical removal of a piece of reality's source code.
