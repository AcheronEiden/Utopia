                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Animation (Tier 10):</strong> Reanimates a single humanoid corpse to serve as a mindless, shambling servant. The construct is slow and unintelligent, obeying only simple commands.</li>

                </ul>

                <h4>Illusion Magic</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phantasmal Foe (Tier 5):</strong> Creates a single, semi-real illusion of a creature to distract an opponent. It has no substance but can cause mental distress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Charm Person (Tier 10):</strong> Temporarily influences the target to view the caster as a trusted friend and ally. More powerful minds can resist this effect.</li>

                </ul>

                <h4>Fire Magic</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ignite (Tier 1):</strong> A simple utility spell that creates a small, controlled flame to light a torch or campfire</li>
                    <li><strong>Firebolt (Tier 5):</strong> The standard offensive fire spell for apprentices, launching a fast-moving bolt of fire at a target</li>
                    <li><strong>Wall of Flame (Tier 10):</strong> Conjures a stationary curtain of fire, useful for blocking passages and deterring enemies</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Wind Magic</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gust (Tier 1):</strong> A basic cantrip that produces a targeted puff of air, strong enough to snuff a candle or rustle papers</li>
                    <li><strong>Feather Step (Tier 5):</strong> Reduces the caster's weight and muffles their footsteps, allowing for greater agility and stealth</li>
                    <li><strong>Silent Walker (Tier 5):</strong> Masks the sounds of the caster's movements, allowing for silent and undetected movement</li>
                    <li><strong>Cyclone Burst (Tier 10):</strong> Creates a small, violent vortex of wind to throw enemies off balance and deflect non-magical projectiles</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Lightning Magic (Advanced Wind and Fire Magic)</h4>
                <ul>

                </ul>

                 <h4>Earth Magic</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Earthen Grasp (Tier 10):</strong> Causes hands made of solid rock to erupt from the ground and attempt to immobilize a target</li>
                    <li><strong>Tremor (Tier 10):</strong> Sends a powerful shockwave through the ground, capable of knocking opponents off their feet and cracking stone structures in a wide area.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Metal Magic (Advanced Earth Magic)</h4>

                    <li><strong>Summon Metal Golem (Tier 15):</strong> Gathers ambient metal and shapes it into a large, powerful, semi-sentient golem that obeys the caster's commands. The golem's strength depends on the quality and quantity of the metal used.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximize Magic: Adamantine Prison (Tier 20):</strong> An ancient Dwarven spell that raises an inescapable prison of magical, unbreakable adamantine around a target, said to be immune to all known forms of damage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Water/Ice Magic</h4>

                </ul>

                <h4>Gravity Magic</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Zero Gravity (Tier 5):</strong> Negates gravity around the target, causing them to float weightlessly</li>

                    <li><strong>Singularity Prison (Super-Tier Spell):</strong> A spell that manipulates gravity to a truly absolute degree. The caster targets a single point in space and amplifies its gravitational pull to near-infinite levels, creating a temporary, microscopic singularity—a black hole. The target is not crushed in the conventional sense but is instead trapped within a pocket of warped spacetime from which nothing, not even light, can escape. The consequences are catastrophic; maintaining the singularity requires immense concentration, and its collapse releases a devastating gravitational wave, capable of leveling entire cities.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Space Magic</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blink (Tier 10):</strong> A short-range, line-of-sight teleportation</li>
                    <li><strong>Space Crack (Tier 15):</strong> Connects two different locations with each other by compressing space</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximize Magic; Absorb Elements (Tier 20):</strong> The exact effects of this spell are unknown</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximize Magic: Teleportation (Tier 20):</strong> Allows for instantaneous teleportation across vast distances</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximize Magic: Warp (Tier 20):</strong> This powerful spell allows for instantaneous teleportation to a chosen location</li>
                    <li><strong>Manifold Detachment (Super-Tier Spell):</strong> A spell that fundamentally breaks the laws of physics  and dimensions. The caster targets a large area—a fortress, a forest, an entire island—and surgically "cuts" it out of the fabric of the plane. The detached section of reality is then shunted into its own isolated, inescapable pocket dimension. This is not teleportation, but a permanent exile from the known universe. The borders of this cosmic wound often become unstable "spatial rifts", leaking the horrors of the void into the world.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Creation Magic</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Create Homunculus (Tier 10):</strong> By manipulating raw mana particles, the caster forms a small, temporary, semi-sentient servant made of magical energy and a chosen element. It can perform simple tasks but dissolves after a short time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Genesis Forge (Tier 15):</strong> Allows the user to shape raw matter and mana into a permanent, non-magical object of exquisite complexity, such as a perfectly balanced sword or an intricate key. This spell is the foundation of high-level artifact creation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximize Magic: Animate Life (Tier 20):</strong> The pinnacle of Creation Magic. By following a complex ritual and expending immense power, the caster can create a truly new, non-magical living being from nothingness. The moral implications of this spell are heavily debated by the Heaven Sect.</li>
                    <li><strong>World Seed Genesis (Super-Tier Spell):</strong> The pinnacle of the creation magic, this spell goes beyond creating a single being. The caster imbues a piece of their own soul and an immense amount of mana into a catalyst, creating a World Seed. When placed on a barren or lifeless plane, this seed blossoms into a new, self-sustaining ecosystem, complete with unique magical flora and fauna. This act is considered a Miracle, but it permanently diminishes the caster's own soul, and the new life that evolves is entirely beyond their control, with the potential to become monstrous.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Void Magic</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Void Lash (Tier 10):</strong> Creates a whip-like tendril of pure void energy that erases whatever it touches</li>
                    <li><strong>Void Eyes (Tier 15):</strong> The ability to see mana particles, see in the dark and detect invisible creatures and objects</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximize Magic: Void Sphere (Tier 20):</strong> Within a designated area, use the void to push out all other elements</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Horizon Annulment (Super-Tier Spell):</strong> The ultimate expression of Void Magic's concept of erasure. The caster designates a specific target—be it a living being, an object, or even a magical effect—and completely annuls its existence from a brief period of causality. The target doesn't just die or break; it is removed from the timeline as if it were never there, forcing reality to violently stitch itself together around the new paradox. The consequence of such a flagrant violation of reality is immense; the target may suffer memory loss or have parts of their own history erased, and the area can be plagued by unstable spatial phenomena for centuries.</li>
                </ul>
