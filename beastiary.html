                    The countless planes of the multiverse are teeming with life, much of it hostile to outsiders. While a complete catalog of all creatures is impossible, scholars have identified several notable beings whose power and danger warrant specific mention.

                <h3>The Creature of Nothingness</h3>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> The Hollow Mountains, Battlefield of Despair.</p>
                <p>
                    This enigmatic entity is less a creature and more a sentient, metaphysical force that manifests as a thick, milky-white mist. It is the apex horror of the Hollow Mountains. The Creature of Nothingness does not hunt or kill in a conventional sense; it erases. Beings enveloped by its mist are not merely slain but are slowly and completely dissolved—body, mana, and soul—until they are wiped from existence as if they had never been.
                </p>

                    What can contain the Void?<br>
                    Nothing can.<br>
                    Gods used nothing to envelop the void, and placed the cage of desire above it...<br>
                    I am wary of nobody, and fear nothing.

                        These monstrous arachnids stand at an imposing seven feet tall. Driven by a primal and insatiable hunger, they are ambush predators that lurk in ancient ruins and deep caves. Their chitinous exoskeletons are highly resistant to attacks, and they ensnare prey in webs woven from tangible shadow, which are nearly invisible and drain the life force of those caught within.

                    <p>
                        A twisted mockery of the life-giving phoenix, the Infernal Phoenix is a being of absolute destruction. Wreathed in the fiery essence of a dying star, its flames do not grant rebirth but inflict the agony of a final, torturous death. The fire it wields cannot be extinguished by conventional means, as it burns not just the body but the very concept of what it touches.

                    <p>
                        Not so much a single creature as a mobile, sentient extension of the plane's will, a Sylvan Ancient is a guardian of the primordial forests of Syl'vanar. Appearing as a colossal, humanoid figure woven from ancient wood and living vines, its heart is a core of pure, condensed life energy. They are implacably territorial and can command the flora around them, turning a serene forest into a deadly cage of grasping roots.

                    <p>
                        These are not to be confused with the common dragons found on the material planes. Void Dragons are a primordial race of immense power, perfectly adapted to the desolate expanse beyond known reality. Their scales are like shards of solidified emptiness. They do not breathe fire, but exhale beams of pure entropy that can destabilize reality or create temporary "space tears".

                    <p>A mindless entity born from the pure chaos of the Abyss, the Abyssal Maw is a writhing mass of black tentacles, gnashing teeth, and bone fragments. Its only instinct is to consume. Its danger lies in its unpredictability and its ability to pull victims into its central mass to be shredded and absorbed by countless mouths.</p>

                    <p>One of the "Great Abominations" that wanders the misty passes of the Hollow Mountains. This gigantic, six-armed beast is covered in thick, matted fur and possesses immense physical strength capable of shattering cliffsides. Its danger is its raw, territorial brute force, dwarfing all but the most powerful intruders.</p>

                    <p>A humanoid entity formed from the superheated ash and crystallized rage of fallen warriors. Its body is a fragile shell of cracked magma over a core of pure fury. Its primary danger is its soul-shattering shriek, a sonic weapon that can boil blood and shatter minds. It explodes violently upon death.</p>

                    <p>A semi-liquid, colonial organism composed of thousands of individual slime-like bodies, each with a single glowing green eye. It flows through deep, forgotten caverns, absorbing all organic matter in its path.

                    <p>A skeletal, avian horror made from the petrified roots of trees that have fed on cursed soil, animated by a malevolent spirit. It is unnaturally fast and silent. Its danger comes from its claws, which inflict necrotic wounds that cannot be healed by conventional magic and cause flesh to rot away.</p>

                    <p>An amphibious predator that dwells in the murkiest swamps. It uses its long, scythe-like arms to slice at prey from beneath the water. Its primary danger is its bite, which carries a potent, flesh-rotting toxin. The green membranes on its arms can also flash with a hypnotic light to lure victims closer.</p>

                    <p>A vengeful nature spirit inhabiting a tree that was burned by demonic or cursed flames. Its body is charred wood, but its core is an undying ember of rage. Its danger is its ability to spread a magical fire that consumes life energy instead of wood, and its touch can turn living flesh to ash.</p>

                    <p>A high-ranking demon that draws power directly from spilled blood. It acts as a herald for a greater Demon Lord, appearing on sites of immense slaughter.

                        <p>A dragon-like entity of unknown origin, named for its nature that seems to predate the known cosmos. They are a source of terror for all mages as they do not use mana, void magic, or any known energy. Their danger is an aura of "cosmic apathy" that nullifies magic and unravels the fundamental Laws of the universe in their vicinity. Spells fizzle into nothingness, enchanted items crumble into dust, and even the air seems to forget its nature. To face an Elder Beast is to face a living embodiment of un-creation, a creature whose very existence is a contradiction to the fabric of reality.</p>

                        <p>A race of silent, humanoid entities that drift through the Everlasting Void. They appear to be woven from pure static and tangled scribbles of light and shadow. Its face is a horrifying visage with two large, hypnotic eyes that resemble starbursts of collapsing energy, and a wide, jagged mouth is etched into its form. Its very presence disrupts the senses, and staring into its eyes can unravel the mind and erase memories. Their touch causes rapid "mana decay" in cultivators, and their mouths are used to consume the spiritual essence of their prey.</p>

                    A graceful, humanoid figure formed from a single, flawless crystal that constantly shifts through a spectrum of internal colors. Their method of attack is unique; they emit harmonic frequencies that can shatter stone, metal, and bone with ease.

                    A subtle predator that feeds not on flesh, but on destiny itself. It appears as a small, slug-like creature made of shimmering, oily shadow. It attaches itself to a host's spiritual presence and drains their karmic luck, causing their life to spiral into ruin through escalating misfortune.

                <h3>Temporal Hound</h3>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Unknown origin, though whispers suggest they are sometimes utilized by the Sea of Time.</p>
                <p>
                    A terrifying predator that hunts outside the conventional flow of time. A Temporal Hound appears as a sleek, canine beast made of shimmering, distorted air. Its claws and teeth rapidly accelerate the age of whatever they contact, turning flesh to dust and steel to rust in seconds.
