            <div class="content-box">
                <p>
                    The Divine Sect of the Heavenly Demon is a place of immense power and ancient knowledge. The sect is a constant source of fear and fascination, their true nature a mystery that has captivated the minds of many. Whether they are a force of darkness that hungers for destruction and chaos, or simply misunderstood guardians, their presence looms large over the world. The Sect is led by a council of six sixth-order beings and the enigmatic Heavenly Demon. These seven individuals are rumored to reside in what is known as the 7 malevolent palaces.
                </p>

                <h3>Palace of Pleasures (Palace Master: Jardin of Rouge)</h3>
                <p>
                    Lost amidst the dense foliage of the forests of the Lonely Mountain, whispers echo from the palaceâ€™s obsidian walls, wavering tales of forgotten secrets, lurking shadows, and forbidden pleasures.
                    Ruled by <strong>Jardin of Rouge</strong>, this palace reflects the seductive charm and manipulative power of the Primordial Red. Within its walls, whispers promise indulgence, but true satisfaction remains elusive, a testament to Rouge's self-serving nature.
                </p>

                <h3>Palace of Decay (Palace Master: Manoir of Noir)</h3>
                <p>
                    The air within thick with the scent of rot and decay and commanded by <strong>Manoir of Noir</strong>, this palace embodies the Primordial Black's strange duality. Once grand, it now reflects Noir's loyalty to a higher power, twisted by the passage of time.
                </p>

                <h3>Palace of Flames (Palace Master: Forge of Jaune)</h3>
                <p>
                    Casting an otherworldly eerie glow, the Palace of Flames resides at the top of the Lonely Mountain in the middle of an active volcano. Continually engulfed in an inferno and occupied by <strong>Forge of Jaune</strong> stands as a monument to the Primordial Yellow's relentless and destructive nature.
                </p>

                <h3>Palace of Nightmare (Palace Master: Domaine of Blanc)</h3>
                <p>
                    A realm of pure terror, where the darkest nightmares imaginable come to life, their grotesque forms etched on the walls. The rule of <strong>Domaine of Blanc</strong> reflects the chilling power of the Primordial White. Blanc's terrifying personality manifests in the very essence of the palace, where visitors confront their deepest fears.
                </p>

                <h3>Palace of Illusions (Palace Master: Miroir of Violet)</h3>
                <p>
                    A labyrinth of mirrors and mirages, where reality and illusion intertwine, leading to a maddening world of deception. <strong>Miroir of Violet</strong> embodies the manipulative nature of the Primordial Purple. Violet's delight in inflicting pain takes the form of mental torment within the palace's ever-shifting reality.
                </p>

                <h3>Palace of Madness (Palace Master: Labyrinthe of Vert)</h3>
                <p>
                    A place where sanity crumbles, its inhabitants driven to the brink by their own twisted thoughts and maddening actions. <strong>Labyrinthe of Vert</strong>, a woman of unwavering loyalty and dedication, embodies the unique traits of the Primordial Green. She manifests the soul of a place where loyalty itself becomes a form of madness.
                </p>

                <h3>Tomb of the Ancient</h3>
                <p>
                    This is where the leader of the Divine Sect resides, only the name of the place is known!
